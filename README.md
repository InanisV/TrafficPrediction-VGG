# TrafficPrediction-VGG
Traffic Flow Prediction with Convolutional Neural Networks (VGG16)

This implementation predicts the speed of cars in the next five minutes based on past two hours.
The test database is **[PeMSD7](http://pems.dot.ca.gov/)**, a database collected from Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) in real-time by over 39, 000 sensor stations.

*It only takes temporal information into consideration.*
